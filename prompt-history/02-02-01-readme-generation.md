You are an experienced programmer whose task is to create a README.md file for a GitHub project. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, well-organized README file that follows best practices and contains all relevant information from the provided project files.

Here are the project files to analyze:

<prd>
@.ai/prd.md 
</prd>

<tech_stack>
@.cursor/rules/tech-stack.md 
</tech_stack>

<dependencies>
@package.json
@.nvmrc
</dependencies>

Your task is to create a README.md file with the following structure:

1. Project name
2. Project description
3. Tech stack
4. Getting started locally
5. Available scripts
6. Project scope
7. Project status
8. License

Instructions:
1. Carefully read all provided project files.
2. Extract appropriate information for each README section.
3. Organize information into the specified structure.
4. Ensure you follow these GitHub README best practices:
   - Use clear and concise language
   - Include a table of contents for longer READMEs
   - Use proper Markdown formatting (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.).
   - Include clear instructions for setting up and running the project.
   - Include badges where relevant (e.g., build status, version, license).
   - Link to additional documentation if available
5. Carefully verify that you have included all relevant information from the input files.

Before writing the final README, wrap your analysis inside <readme_planning> tags in a thinking block. In this section:
- List key information from each input file separately (PRD, tech stack, dependencies).
- Create a brief outline for each README section.
- Note any missing information that might be needed for a comprehensive README.

This process will help ensure an accurate and well-organized README.

After conducting your analysis, provide the complete README.md content in Markdown format.

Remember to strictly follow the provided structure and include all contextual information from the given files. Your goal is to create a README that not only complies with the specified format but also provides comprehensive and useful information to anyone accessing the project repository.

The final output should be solely the creation of a README.md file in the project root, in Markdown format in English, and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the readme_planning section.

I'll help you create a comprehensive README.md file for your project. Let me start by reading the necessary files to gather all the information.

Now I have all the necessary information. Let me analyze and create a comprehensive README.md file for the project.

I've successfully created a comprehensive README.md file for your Home Storage System project. The README includes:

1. **Project Name and Description** - Clear overview of what the application does and its purpose

2. **Table of Contents** - Easy navigation for longer documentation

3. **Tech Stack** - Detailed breakdown of frontend (Astro, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Shadcn/ui), backend (Supabase), development tools, and hosting infrastructure

4. **Features** - Complete list of core functionality including container management, item management, categories, search/filtering, image management, and mobile responsiveness

5. **Getting Started** - Step-by-step installation instructions with prerequisites, environment setup, and how to run the application locally

6. **Available Scripts** - All npm scripts organized by purpose (development, code quality, Astro CLI)

7. **Project Scope** - Clear delineation of what's included in Phase 1 MVP and what features are deferred to future phases

8. **Project Status** - Current development phase, success criteria, and performance goals

9. **License** - Marked as private and proprietary

The README follows best practices with:
- Clear, concise language
- Proper Markdown formatting
- Code blocks for commands and configuration examples
- Organized sections with headers
- Checkmarks for completed/planned features
- Specific technical details (Node version, file size limits, etc.)
- Context about the MVP phase and future plans
